# Color Sensing Robot Arm
The project we came up with is creating a robot that uses a color sensor that detects the color of an item and sorts it into a bin or a box.

# CAD
## Description
This is a section that will go over all the things that were being made in CAD. 
# Code
## Description
This will be the coding aspect of our project. 
# Milestones
## 11/15-12/2/22
During this time, we were just starting the project, so we were coming up with ideas of what our project will be based on. We were figuring out the basics of how a cylindrical arm works and doing a lot of other research. We were presenting our project pitches and partnering up. 
## 12/5-12/6/22
During this 2 day span, we planned to decide on what our project will look like. Once we did that, we had to create a proof of concept. 
## 12/9-12/16/22 
We started building the robot arm and also started on the coding aspect. We initially planned to have 2 parts of the robot arm done each week. During this time, we had also ordered the color sensor that we needed for the project.
## 12/16-1/6-23
Around this time, we are still continuing the code and CAD. We just got back from winter break so we were resuming our work. At this time we just got the color sensor so we started working on that. 
## 1/9/-1/20/23
Initially we had planned to get the color sensor to trigger 3 different LEDS by detecting 3 different colors, but we swtiched to a RGB LED to make it easier.
