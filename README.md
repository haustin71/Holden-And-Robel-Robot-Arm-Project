# Color Sensing Robot Arm
The project we came up with is creating a robot that uses a TCS34725 color sensor that detects the color of an item and sorts it into a bin or a box. What we ended up creating was a SCARA Robot Arm that theoretically can pick up small objects and place them into a bin.

# Code
This is the code for the Color Sensor, we used arduino because it was easier to understand.

This is the Stepper Motor code, we had to restore the history on VS code so thats why all of the code is highlighted green.

## 1/3-1/14/23
Before winter break, we ordered the color sensor and it got here by the time we got back to school.

## 1/3-1/20/23
During this time, we were working on trying to get the color sensor to work. It took a very long time for the code to be finished. It was pretty tough. 
Here is an image of the finished color sensor code. 

# Robot_Working_Video
We don't have a video of the robot arm because we didn't get to build it.
# Reflection
Overall, I think that this project didn't go that well and I'm disappointed that we didn't get to finish it on time. I think that the biggest issue that we ran into was the time constraint. originally, we planned on spending like 3-4 weeks on the CAD model and Code but we ended up not finishing the CAD and Code by the due date. If we had extra time, I think that we could've finished the project. One other problem that we had was that I think that both my partner and I were over ambitious with our project. By the last two weeks before the deadline, we still hadn't finished both the CAD and the code so we decided to not build it and just focus on finishing the CAD design and have working code. I think that for our next project we should take more time to plan out everything so that we don't make the same mistakes that we did on this project.
