# Color Sensing Robot Arm
The project we came up with is creating a robot that uses a TCS34725 color sensor that detects the color of an item and sorts it into a bin or a box. What we ended up creating was a SCARA Robot Arm that theoretically can pick up small objects and place them into a bin.

## 1/3-1/14/23
Before winter break, we ordered the color sensor and it got here by the time we got back to school.

## 1/3-1/20/23
During this time, we were working on trying to get the color sensor to work. It took a very long time for the code to be finished. It was pretty tough. 
Here is an image of the finished color sensor code. 

# Robot_Working_Video
We don't have a video of the robot arm because we didn't get to build it.
# Reflection
Overall I think that this project didn't go that well and I'm disappointed that we didn't get to finish it on time. I think that the biggest issue that we ran into was the time constraint. originally, we planned on spending like 3-4 weeks on the CAD model and Code but we ended up not finishing the CAD and Code by the due date. If we had extra time, I think that we could've finished the project. One other problem that we had was that I think that both my partner and I were over ambitious with our project.
