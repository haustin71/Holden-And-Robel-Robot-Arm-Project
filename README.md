2. Click the big green Use This Template button at the top of this page.
3. Name the new repository something appropriate to the purpose of your project (Your first one should probably be named `CircuitPython`).
4. Hit "Create repository from template." (The default settings should be fine.)
5. Open VS Code on your machine. Click Clone Repository.
6. Paste in the link to the new repository you've just created from the template and hit enter.
